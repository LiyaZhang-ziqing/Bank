The final project that Zhu and Liya has decided to work on is to build a logistic regression model to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. This model would help the Portuguese banking institution for future direct marketing campaigns. Our final model include the following predictors: last contact duration (duration), euribor 3 month rate (euribor3m), and number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (pdays). 

Based on these 3 predictors, the model we build would provide a target population that are most likely to accept deposit subcriptions to market in order to save resources for the bank. The detail report is located on https://github.com/LiyaZhang-ziqing/Bank/blob/main/Final%20Project%20Report%20(Bank).pdf.

Lastly, we created a heatmap showing the correlation between the subscription status and each predictors. This heatmap is published on https://ancient-forest-16543.herokuapp.com/.

The python file (https://github.com/LiyaZhang-ziqing/Bank/blob/main/app.py) contains all code used in this final project, including data cleaning, logistic regression modeling and heatmap. And the final project markdown file (https://github.com/LiyaZhang-ziqing/Bank/blob/main/Final%20Project%20Markdown%20(Bank).pdf) presents readable version of the python file, including the outputs.
