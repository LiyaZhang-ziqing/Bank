The final project that Zhu and Liya has decided to work on is to build a logistic regression model to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. This model would help the Portuguese banking institution for future direct marketing campaigns. Our final model include the following predictors: employee variation rate (emp.var.rate), last contact duration (duration), consumer price index (cons.price.idx), number of employees (nr.employed), contact communication type (contact), number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (pdays), consumer confidence index (cons.conf.idx), if the consumer has credit in default (default), number of contacts performed before this campaign for this client (previous). Based on these 9 predictors, the model we build would provide a target population that are most likely to accept deposit subcriptions to market in order to save resources for the bank.
Lastly, we created a heatmap showing the correlation between the subscription status and each predictors. This heatmap is published on https://ancient-forest-16543.herokuapp.com/.
The python file (https://github.com/LiyaZhang-ziqing/Bank/blob/main/app.py) contains all code used in this final project, including data cleaning, logistic regression modeling and heatmap. And the final project markdown file presents readable version of the python file, including the outputs.
